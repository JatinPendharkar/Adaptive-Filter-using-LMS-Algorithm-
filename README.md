Problem statement is given in TPS DSP(1).pdf

IMPLEMENTATION OF LMS FIR BASED ADAPTIVE FILTER FOR SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION â€“ 
DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING.
Language and Platform: MATLAB
About: Filters are the most significant instrument in signal processing applications like audio equalizers, picture processing, and so on. As a result, we used an adaptive filter for system identification in our suggested technique. The system must be identified before the filter can be implemented; this is done using Least Men Square (LMS). Because noise is a property that changes over time when a device is operated remotely, we need an adaptation strategy to account for any type of noise that may damage our system and mitigate its impacts in order to provide improved signal quality. As the signal adapts to the original signal, the Mean Squared Error decreases with time. Our proposed algorithm performed according to the desired expectation and can be implemented for System Identification
